== Description ==
What is this?

QuickPost is a plugin consisting of a bookmarklet which will be added to your links toolbar, and a blog editor triggered by the bookmarklet. The options are inspired by the Tumblr (http://www.tumblr.com) weblog system. It is a great service but it's not Wordpress/

What does it do?

When you click the Quickpost bookmarklet from any web site, a new window will pop up. The URL of the page you're on, linked with the title of the page, will automatically be transferred to the editor in that window. You can do almost everything you do with the default editor of WordPress (like dragging&dropping pictures, formatting your post, selecting categories etc..) and create a new post for your blog.

License?

The code is open, whoever wishes to do anything about it is welcome to tinker. Thanks to menguzar & culdesac (http://www.keditasmasi.com) for the start. I can't wait to see who tinker's next.
